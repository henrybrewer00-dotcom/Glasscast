### Create polished demo videos in minutes
[Glasscast](https://glasscast.app) is your **open-source screen recorder** and editor for **walkthroughs, demos, product videos**, and more. 
**Accepting PRs.**

> Glasscast builds on **[Recordly](https://github.com/webadderallorg/Recordly)** (AGPLv3) by webadderall — itself derived from **[OpenScreen](https://github.com/siddharthvaddem/openscreen)** by Siddharth Vaddem. Much of Glasscast has been rewritten or built fresh, but Recordly's code was used as a reference throughout (especially the macOS screen-recording permissions), and portions remain — so full credit is due to the Recordly and OpenScreen authors. Per the AGPLv3, Glasscast is released under the same license. See [Credits](#credits).

## What is Glasscast?

Glasscast is a desktop app for recording and editing screen captures with motion-driven presentation tools built in. Instead of sending raw footage to a motion designer just to add zooms, cursor polish, or a styled background, Glasscast handles that workflow in one place for free.

Glasscast runs on:

- **macOS** 14.0+
- **Windows** 10 Build 19041+
- **Linux** on modern distros

Platform notes:

- **macOS** uses native ScreenCaptureKit-based capture helpers.
- **Windows** uses a native Windows Graphics Capture (WGC) helper on supported builds, with native WASAPI audio support.
- **Linux** records through Electron capture APIs. Cursor hiding is not supported on Linux today.

# Core Features

## Auto-zooms, cursor polish, and styled frames
Glasscast can automatically emphasize activity with zoom suggestions, smooth cursor movement, add motion effects, and place the final composition inside a styled frame with wallpapers, colors, gradients, blur, padding, and shadows.

## Dynamic webcam bubble overlays
Add webcam footage as an overlay bubble, position it with presets or custom coordinates, mirror it, control shadow and roundness, and optionally make it react to zoom so it stays visually balanced during motion.

</p>

## Timeline editing built for demos
Use drag-and-drop timeline tools for zooms, trims, speed regions, annotations, extra audio regions, and crop-aware edits. Save and reopen work as `.glasscast` project files.

## Extensions & Marketplace

Glasscast has a community-driven extension system. Anyone can build and publish extensions that add new capabilities to Glasscast — cursor click sounds, device frames, browser mockups, wallpapers, render hooks, settings panels, and more.

Extensions are loaded locally for now — a hosted Glasscast marketplace is on the roadmap.

# Installation

## Download a build

Prebuilt releases are available at:

https://github.com/henrybrewer00-dotcom/Glasscast/releases

## Build from source

### Recommended: set it up with an AI agent

Glasscast is a large Electron + native project, so the fastest way to get it running is to let a coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.) drive the setup. Clone the repo, open your agent **in the project root**, and paste this prompt:

```text
Set up and run Glasscast — this is an Electron + Vite + React + TypeScript desktop app.

1. Check prerequisites: Node.js 20+, and on macOS the Xcode Command Line Tools
   (run `xcode-select -p`; if it errors, tell me to run `xcode-select --install`).
   On Linux/Windows, install the build prerequisites listed in this README.
2. Run `npm install`. Its `postinstall` step compiles native helpers — if that
   fails, read the error and fix the missing toolchain rather than skipping it.
3. Start the app in dev with `npm run dev`. If I want a packaged installer
   instead, run `npm run build:mac` (or `build:win` / `build:linux`) and tell me
   where it landed (the `release/` folder).
4. Run `npm test` and confirm the suite passes.
5. Tell me how to grant Screen Recording permission the first time I record:
   System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording → enable Glasscast,
   then relaunch the app.
6. Explain bring-your-own-key AI: Glasscast ships no API keys. In the editor open
   the "AI Keys" tab to add an OpenAI, Anthropic, or OpenRouter key for the AI
   agent, and add a captions key (OpenAI / Groq / Deepgram) or use local Whisper.
   Keys are stored encrypted on-device and are never committed.

Don't commit anything or add new dependencies without asking me first. If a step
fails, show me the exact error and your proposed fix before continuing.
```

Prefer doing it by hand? The manual steps are right below.

### Prerequisites

**macOS:** Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libx11-dev libxtst-dev libxrandr-dev libxt-dev
```

**Windows:** Visual Studio 2022 (or Build Tools) with the C++ workload and CMake.

### Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/henrybrewer00-dotcom/Glasscast.git glasscast
cd glasscast
npm install
npm run dev
```

For packaged builds:

```bash
npm run build
```

Target-specific build commands are also available:

- `npm run build:mac`
- `npm run build:win`
- `npm run build:linux`

## macOS: "App cannot be opened"

Locally built apps may be quarantined by macOS.

Remove the quarantine flag with:

```bash
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Glasscast.app
```

# System Requirements

| Platform | Minimum version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** | macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) | Required for ScreenCaptureKit audio and microphone capture. |
| **Windows** | Windows 10 20H1 (Build 19041, May 2020) | Required for the native Windows Graphics Capture (WGC) helper and best cursor-hiding behavior. |
| **Linux** | Any modern distro | Recording works through Electron capture. System audio generally requires PipeWire. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On Windows builds older than 19041, recording can still work through fallback capture, but the real OS cursor may remain visible in recordings.

---

# Usage

## Record

1. Launch Glasscast.
2. Select a screen or window.
3. Choose microphone and system-audio options.
4. Start recording.
5. Stop recording to open the editor.

## Edit

Inside the editor you can:

- add trims, zooms, speed regions, and annotations
- tune cursor behavior and preview volume
- style the frame with wallpapers, colors, gradients, blur, padding, and corners
- add or adjust webcam overlay footage
- add extra audio regions
- crop the frame and choose an aspect ratio

Save your work anytime as a `.glasscast` project.

## Export

Export options include:

- **MP4** for standard video output
- **GIF** for lightweight sharing and loops

You can adjust format-specific settings such as quality, GIF frame rate, GIF looping, and output size before export.

---

# Limitations

### Cursor capture

Glasscast renders a polished cursor overlay on top of the recording. Platform cursor-hiding behavior still depends on OS support.

**macOS**
- ScreenCaptureKit can exclude the real cursor cleanly.

**Windows**
- Best results require Windows 10 Build 19041+ and the native capture helper.
- Older builds fall back to Electron capture, so the real cursor may remain visible.

**Linux**
- Electron desktop capture does not currently support cursor hiding.
- If you also enable the rendered cursor overlay, exports may show both the real cursor and the styled cursor.

### System audio

System audio support varies by platform.

**Windows**
- Native WASAPI support

**Linux**
- Usually requires PipeWire

**macOS**
- Requires macOS 14.0+ and the ScreenCaptureKit-based workflow

---

# How It Works

Glasscast combines a platform-specific capture layer with a renderer-driven editor and export pipeline.

**Capture**
- Electron coordinates recording and application flow
- macOS uses native ScreenCaptureKit helpers
- Windows uses a native Windows Graphics Capture (WGC) helper and native audio helpers where available

**Editing**
- Timeline regions define zooms, trims, speed changes, audio overlays, and annotations
- Cursor and webcam styling are applied in the editor state

**Rendering**
- Scene composition is handled by **PixiJS**

**Export**
- The same scene logic used in preview is rendered into exported MP4 or GIF output

**Projects**
- `.glasscast` files store the source media path plus editor state so work can be reopened later
